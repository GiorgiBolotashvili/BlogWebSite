                <p class="col-md-10">
                    2020 was a challenging year for both Georgia and the whole world. This year greatly impacted technology and helped digital technologies and mobile applications to develop faster. However, it must be said, that smartphones take up a huge amount of people’s lives and it is necessary to pay more attention to the real world. INSTINCTY is a combination of these two opinions. By using technology it allows us to create profiles to show to society the desired side of us, but it also helps us to go outside and get useful information just by moving.
Everyone needs a technological innovation that makes life easier and considering the pandemic, helps create a healthier environment.
By avoiding unnecessary communication we lower the risks of spreading the virus, but also lose new chances and opportunities. INSTINCTY helps us to maintain those changes and opportunities.
Main commercialization targets are companies, shopping centers, and restaurants. INSTINCTY knows where customers are and what they need. INSTINCTY allows partner companies to send offers to users by being close to the location and while being close to the locations of competitor companies, offers them better conditions or discounts. The target audience of this strategy is users looking at products they have decided to buy. The same strategy can work at gas stations and restaurants.
The platform will have interesting games that will help motivate users to use INSTINCTY.
Mentioned features are already built into the platform and ready to be used. Our legal company, data protection policy, and rules have already been agreed with Apple, so INSTINCTY by CLEVER LLC can be found on both App Store and Play store. Our servers are located in Germany. A specific code that automatically sorts user information and sends them offers has already been written, in accordance with Georgian legislation. In conclusion, all rights are reserved.

                        INSTINCTY does not have direct competitors, but the combination of popular social media and meeting platforms can be seen as its indirect competitors. For example, Tinder and Badoo, but are more dating platforms, which narrows their usage. Users there can connect from a long distance. Mentioned platforms do not allow subscribing, which is offered by Instagram, but getting followers there takes a lot of time and budget.
INSTINCTY is a social media platform, that has interesting and unique functions and offers a different direction. Unlike big companies, we can create more opportunities and offer comfortable tools, such as high-quality photo uploads, the ability to gain subscribers in a short time, etc.

                        INSTINCTY needs so-called ‘back-end development’ to get a wide market share, which will take approximately one month. After this, an intensive promoting and platform development process can start.
During a certain period, ads for INSTINCTY should be shown frequently in multiple places.
Using digital marketing, video ads and download links will be shown to a specific segment on different social media platforms. INSTINCTY can also be advertised by influencers, by offering them specific benefits on the platform. 
INSTINCTY is a platform that is dependent on the number of its users. Because of this, on the launch date and the start of the intense marketing, an entertaining game can be offered to users, giving them a specific prize.
For example: when you download an application, clues are offered. By guessing them, you end up at specific locations, e.g shops, educational institutions, etc. This will help promote chosen locations and give INSTINCTY additional resources. A game will help users to get to know platforms' boundless possibilities and help the platform to gain an audience.

                        INSTINCTY will not be geographically restricted. After establishing in Georgia, we plan to register citizens of other countries on the platform. Similar activities will be planned to gain a market share in other countries too (supposedly, after a year). But before that, the grant will help us to test the platform’s abilities in Georgia, improve INSTINCTY and receive additional income from different companies, from which some already are our partners, and finally, proudly present INSTINCTY on a global market.
Our application offers 3 ways of making a profit, but additional sources can be added in the future:
1.Promotion of partners and their products, helping them in the realization process (for example, we can offer companies a place on the map, from which the users will be able to view their profile and subscribe to them).
The target audience – Users who are close to the locations of the competitors, and/or the locations of our partners, will receive offers/discounts even when they are offline. Prices of these kinds of messages will be specific, like on other social media platforms, people are charged for potential clients.
2.Charging for additional features (for example, getting pinned on a specific location, or a specific color, drawing on a profile)
3.Income received from Tokenization.
