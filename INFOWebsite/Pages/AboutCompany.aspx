                    <p class="mainText">
                        The goal of CLEVERY LLC is to develop an innovative product, INSTINCTY, a new marketing tool, 
                        and a social media platform.
                        The company was created in late 2019 and now has a product that has been developed over time.
                        And now we have an interesting MVP.

                <h2>Financial Capacity</h2>
                <p class="mainText">
                    CLEVERY LLC received the funding of GEL 28 000 from European University on a term of the platform promoting the 
                    university among graduates from different schools and a promise of assistance.
                    The company still pays GEL 9 000 for video editing, a domain, servers, registration SMS, and other expenses.
                    GEL 21 000 for software management was paid to the development company “Ginials” on the basis of a service agreement.
                    Nika Bitsadze and Giga Bokuchava, who work at the development company showed interested in our platform.
                    Since the start of the global pandemic, which was a force majeure for our company, we have been able to work with developers
                    throughout 2020 to improve/develop INSTINCTY, so INSTINCTY spent a lot more resources than software worth GEL 21,000.
                    The GITA grant would help us gain a wide market share, improve, find funds easier, and most importantly,
                    commercialize INSTINCTY as soon as possible. Promoting the application in Tbilisi will cause society’s interest.
                    5000-10 000 users should be enough for the platform to go viral and because of this, the development and renovation 
                    process of INSTINCTY should not stop.

                    <h2>Innovative Technology</h2>
                    <p class="mainText">
                        INSTINCTY is written with c# programming language and Xamarin. Forms frameworks is used. C# and asp.net core 3.1 frameworks 
                        were used in the Server part. The database is PostgreSQL, and the administrative panel is c# and Blazor.
                        After the user closes the application and starts moving, with or without an internet connection, INSTINCTY collects the information 
                        and sorts it in specific columns. Users can check the information after, but certain offers from companies are sent to them 
                        as pop-up messages even if they are offline. At the same time, INSTINCTY suggests user’s profiles to potential subscribers 
                        and promotes their accounts.In a technological sense, the platform sends details of the users to the server database every 2-3 
                        seconds. The server reads the information, compares it to the nearby data, and sends corresponding data to other users: 
                        either as a profile suggestion, or an offer. In case of not having an internet connection, the gathered information is sent 
                        to the user as soon as their connection is restored. Ads based on locations are planned and get to users who happen to be at 
                        those specific locations.INSTINCTY will be a great tool for travelers because while being in a new city, they will get a map, 
                        information about interesting locations, offers, and people, which will help them adapt faster to foreign places. 
                        It will be useful at business forums, as it will indicate to the needed person instead of having to talk to many people. 
                        Avoiding unnecessary communication protects our health and helps us save time and energy. INSTINCTY will also work well at music 
                        festivals because with its help you will never lose a friend there again. INSTINCTY is almost ready to proudly present itself 
                        on the Georgian market. It will soon acquire new, creative, innovative functions, which are already processed and only need 
                        technical development. It can be boldly said that INSTINCTY will soon spread further in Georgia with the help of lovers of 
                        novelty and innovation.

                    <p class="mainText">
                        INSTINCTY’s current concept allows us to predict its boundless and fast development. The platform may be used for both 
                        entertainment and commercial purposes. It will allow users to express themselves and promote their work and can also be 
                        used to earn digital currency, cashback, and tokenization. INSTINCTY has unique features, politics, and purpose. 
                        Unlike other platforms, INSTINCTY’s goal is not to charge money to gain more subscribers or to over-advertise, 
                        but to help its users directly use resources commercially. NSTINCTY’s server-aspect, specifically the method of 
                        collecting and spreading information is an illustration of hard work and is fast, precise, smooth, and mistake-free.
                        Photos on INSTINCTY will be uploaded in the highest quality, which will be a rare luxury for Georgian society. Besides,
                        there are many creative and useful functions. For example, closed codes, which will make the application more diverse. 
                        The more people feel comfortable using the platform, the more information it will collect, which will allow users to pick 
                        specific locations and make offers to people there. Interesting games will also be added to the application, which will allow 
                        users to learn its functions and contribute to the company’s success. We can say that it is impossible to fix problems by 
                        duplicating platforms that already exist on the market. This would be the same as creating a new Google, or Facebook, which 
                        would have no users.
